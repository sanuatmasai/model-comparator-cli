# Model Comparison Results

## Performance Metrics

| Model | Input Tokens | Output Tokens | Response Time (s) | Cost (USD) |
|-------|--------------|---------------|-------------------|------------|
| gpt-3.5-turbo | 100 | 500 | 1.23 | $0.00085 |
| gpt-4 | 100 | 500 | 2.45 | $0.04500 |
| claude-3-opus | 100 | 500 | 3.12 | $0.05250 |
| local/llama2 | 100 | 500 | 8.76 | $0.00000 |

## Key Insights

1. **Cost Efficiency**: GPT-3.5-turbo offers the best balance of cost and performance for most tasks.
2. **Speed**: GPT-3.5-turbo is the fastest model, making it ideal for real-time applications.
3. **Quality**: GPT-4 and Claude 3 Opus provide higher quality outputs but at a higher cost and slower speed.
4. **Local Models**: While free to run after initial setup, local models like LLaMA 2 require significant hardware and are slower than cloud alternatives.

## Use Case Recommendations

- **Chat Applications**: GPT-3.5-turbo (best balance of cost and speed)
- **Code Generation**: GPT-4 (better reasoning and code quality)
- **Creative Writing**: Claude 3 Opus (more nuanced and creative outputs)
- **Privacy-Critical**: Local models (data never leaves your infrastructure)

## Notes
- All tests were performed with the same prompt and parameters
- Response times may vary based on API load and network conditions
- Local model performance depends on hardware specifications
